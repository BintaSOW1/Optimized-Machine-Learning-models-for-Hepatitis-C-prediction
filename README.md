# Optimized-Machine-Learning-models-for-Hepatitis-C-prediction


Abstract
Machine learning techniques have gained significant attention for their potential in solving diverse real-world problems across various fields. This study focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict the stage of Hepatitis C, a prevalent liver disease affecting a substantial portion of the global pop- ulation. By employing a dataset encompassing 615 patients and incorporating a multitude of factors associated with Hepatitis C, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to compare the performance of six prominent machine learning algorithms. The algorithms considered include categorical boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest (RF), and ExtraTreeClas- sifier (ExtraT). To optimize the performance of these models, a hyperparameter optimization technique called Optuna was used to identify the optimal param- eters for each algorithm. Subsequently, the performance of the models were

evaluated using the test dataset, comprising 20% of the overall patient data. The research findings revealed that the XGBoost algorithm emerged as the most effective approach, exhibiting a remarkable accuracy of 94.31%. Furthermore, the XGBoost model demonstrated exceptional F1-score, precision, and recall values, measuring 94.23%, 94.63%, and 94.31%, respectively. Building upon these promis- ing results, we deployed the XGBoost model in a user-friendly web application leveraging Streamlit. This deployment ensures easy accessibility and usability of the model for the broader community.
